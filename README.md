tlep-couplings
==============

Code to run couplings for TLEP /ILC by given XS x BR measurements

This code requires that you have ROOT version +RooFit installed and set up

To run the code , run the datacard with python(i.e)

With constraints on the direct search for invisible Higgs decays:

```
python runTLEP_2_fixWH_fixInv.py
```

And without: 

```
python runTLEP_2_fixWH.py
```
